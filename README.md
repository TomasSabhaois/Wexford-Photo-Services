# Wexford-Photo-Services
MileStone Project One Code Insitute

This is my first MileStone Project for Code Insitute.  I found it very intresting to do a webpage for a fictional website.


Wexford Photography Services

Wexford Photography Services is a fictional website for people intrested in taking up photography
or using photo editing apps.  It was set up in 2015 by three friends Tom Dick and Harry.  It was set up to
promote their work and the work of their students.  


UX & Styling

Background Images
The two images (Hook Lighhouse and Johnstown Castle) are the background of the homepage and About and
and services pages.  They are iconic wexford landmarks.

Fonts
Impact, Arial Narrow Bold and San-Serif were my fonts of choice in this project.  I didn't want to
over complicate the project. 

Positing
I felt centering the text would be more eye catching for the user instead of looking around the screen
for information.

Home Page
This is letting the user know what this website offers to people and what Wexford Photo Services has to
offer people

About Page
This is a letting the user know what the history of Wexford Photo Services is.  Also it helps the user
know what to expect from the website.

Services
This is what Wexford Photo Services offers to people who are intrested in photography or those
who are looking for a gift from someone at home or abroad.  It also show cases the the work by the 
three founders and their students of the Photography and Photoshop classes. (These images were
sourced from google images since it is a fictional website.). They are locatations and landmarks
that can be found in Wexford.  

Header & Footer
These exist across all pages, the Header consitsts of the title Wexford Photo Services and nav links to the 
pages, while the Footer consists of contact details which consists of a fictional phone number and email for 
contact purposes and links to their socail media pages which showcases their work.
