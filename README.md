This is my first MileStone Project for Code Insitute.  I found it very intresting to do a webpage for a fictional website.


Wexford Photography Services

Wexford Photography Services is a fictional website for people intrested in taking up photography
or using photo editing apps.  It was set up in 2015 by three friends Tom Dick and Harry.  It was set up to
promote their work and the work of their students.  


UX & Styling

Background Images
The two images (Hook Lighhouse and Johnstown Castle) are the background of the homepage and About and
and services pages.  They are iconic wexford landmarks.

Fonts

Impact, Arial Narrow Bold and San-Serif were my fonts of choice in this project.  I didn't want to
over complicate the project. 

Positing

I felt centering the text would be more eye catching for the user instead of looking around the screen
for information.

Home Page

This is letting the user know what this website offers to people and what Wexford Photo Services has to
offer people

About Page
This is a letting the user know what the history of Wexford Photo Services is.  Also it helps the user
know what to expect from the website.

Services

This is what Wexford Photo Services offers to people who are intrested in photography or those
who are looking for a gift from someone at home or abroad.  It also show cases the the work by the 
three founders and their students of the Photography and Photoshop classes. (These images were
sourced from google images since it is a fictional website.). They are locatations and landmarks
that can be found in Wexford.  

Header & Footer

These exist across all pages, the Header consitsts of the title Wexford Photo Services and nav links to the 
pages, while the Footer consists of contact details which consists of a fictional phone number and email for 
contact purposes and links to their socail media pages which showcases their work.

Issues & Bug Fixes

A few issues arose in the project.  The margin and padding had to be ajusted to allow images and text could be more visually 
appealing for the user.  It wasnt overly difficult to fix these issues.  After two mentor calls it was reccomended to showcase some work
by students and teachers on the Wexofrd Photo Services page.  Similar to other Photo Websites showing their work I aquired photos of
Wexoford landmarks and points of intrest from around the county.  This made the site more visually appealing.  The header and Footer
remained in black and white for looks. After my mentor calls change had to be made based on the UX design of the Website.  Bases on these
recommendations I made necessary changes to the code and design to make the websice more appealing and user frindly.

Final Thoughts

A number of changes were made to the project based on mentor reccomendations, and particular aspects not working out.  For the 
Header and Footer I used an image instead of the black background and white text.  The background images were taken out of the pages
expect for the homepage which hadn't much detail put into it.  The about page ended up with two colums with the history of the 
business and the three Tutors Tom Dick and Harry. The services page had three colums with what was offered to people who are intrested
in photography - Photography Classes, Photoshop and Photo Restoration.  The Photo page simply consisted of photos of Wexoford landmarks
and other places in the County sources from the internet.  The Contact page consisted of a simple form to be completed
by someone who may be intrested in photography.  I also found I strayed from the Wireframe and lost vital time in doing the project.
